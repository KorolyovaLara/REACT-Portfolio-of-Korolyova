        <p class="lead">Hello there. My name is Lara Korolyova.</p>
        <p class="lead">
          I am born and raised in Ukraine. I crossed the oceans and moved on my
          own to Australia when I was 19. But that wasn't my dream or wish. At
          that time I chased dreams of my family for a better life. I completed
          2 bachelor's degrees specializing in Economics in Marine Transport and
          Business with a major in Accounting.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          Through the years I have built a successful career in the transport
          industry. I became an Australian citizen. But at 30 years old, during
          the COVID lockdown, I felt that something was missing. I still had a
          dream of mine that I never chased. And that is when I enrolled at
          Univesity again to learn Coding and Web Development. That was my dream
          and my passion! I have always been interested in the IT side of
          things: in programs and games, in applications and websites, how
          things work behind the pretty picture at the front.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          Now, I am creating websites and applications to help others chase
          their dreams.
        </p>
        <h4 class="fw-bold lh-1 mb-3">
          I am going to help you and your business to stand out on the Web. From
          small ideas to big, we gonna make it shine.
